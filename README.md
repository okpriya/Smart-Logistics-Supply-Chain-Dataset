# Smart-Logistics-Supply-Chain-Dataset
The dataset provides real-time data for smart logistics operations, capturing various aspects of supply chain management over the past year (2024).
It includes information on asset tracking, inventory levels, shipment statuses, environmental conditions, traffic, and user behaviors. 
The dataset features multiple stakeholders within the logistics network, including asset IDs, timestamps, traffic conditions, waiting times, and reasons for delays. 
Additionally, the data is enriched with real-time information from IoT sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and asset utilization, 
to facilitate advanced logistics optimization and decision-making. The target variable, Logistics_Delay, helps in identifying delays in logistics processes,
which is essential for enhancing supply chain efficiency through proactive management and optimization techniques. 
This dataset is designed to be used for research and machine learning applications focused on smart logistics and supply chain performance improvement.
